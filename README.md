# Introduction
Maintaining efficient incident response plans becomes more difficult for corporations as cyber threats become more complex. In order to provide analysts with situational, actionable guidance, traditional methodologies sometimes rely on static playbooks that are not flexible enough to react to changing threat scenarios. 

In order to fill these gaps, we have created an AI-powered chatbot named **MiAtbot** that provides users with real-time, structured guidance that is based on industry standards, enhanced with the most recent threat data from MITRE ATT&CK â„¢ Framework, and customized to meet their individual needs.
